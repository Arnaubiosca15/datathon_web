<h2>CLAUSES</h2>

<h2>1. OBJECT</h2>

<p>By virtue of this Agreement the Participant or Attendee agrees to participate in the event Datathon FME organized by AED.</p>

<p>These T&amp;C apply to both the Participants and the Attendees, although some of its clauses may only be applicable to the Participant given their role in the Datathon.</p>

<h2>2. Datathon FME COMPETITION RULES</h2>

<p>These are the Datathon FME competition rules. They are a customized version of the standard competition rules used at MLH Member Hackathons. If you have a suggestion for these rules or a question about them, please submit it to the e-mail address provided.</p>

<h3>The rules of the competition</h3>

<ol>
  <li>There is no minimum team size, however, the maximum size is 4 people. There will be 1 prize for each member of the team, independently of the team size.</li>
  <li>Teams should be made up exclusively of students who are not organizers, judges, sponsors, or in any other privileged position at the event. Volunteers are allowed to participate in their free time, accepting the extra difficulty of hacking and volunteering at the same time, but their role won’t give them any judging advantage in front of the rest of participants.</li>
  <li>All team members should be accepted into the hackathon by the organization and registered into the online platforms/forms used before and during the event.</li>
  <li>All team members should be reachable by any member of the organization team during the event.</li>
  <li>Teams can of course gain advice and support from organizers, volunteers, sponsors, mentors and other related people to the datathon.</li>
  <li>All work on a project should be done at the datathon.</li>
  <li>Teams can use an idea they had before the event.</li>
  <li>Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. Solutions do not have to be “innovative”, although it's a plus.</li>
  <li>Teams can work on an idea that they have worked on before (as long as they do not re-use code).</li>
  <li>Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed.</li>
  <li>Adding new features to existing projects is allowed. Judges will only consider new functionality introduced or new features added during the Datathon in determining the winners.</li>
  <li>Teams must stop working once the time is up. However, teams are allowed to make small fixes to their programs/documents after time is up. Making large changes or adding new features is not allowed.</li>
  <li>Projects that violate the Code of Conduct are not allowed (clause 3).</li>
  <li>Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers’ discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, breaking the Code of Conduct, or other unsporting behaviour.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Demos</h3>

<p>After hacking finishes, teams will show their projects to each other and to the judges.</p>

<p>In order to present your project to Datathon FME judges and sponsors you would need to be able to sing up and log in to third party services complining with the applicable law of your country. Agreeing with the terms and conditions of any third party service suggested, used or proposed by the organization.</p>

<p>You are strongly encouraged to present a demo of what you have built. Pitches or presentations are also an option.</p>

<p>You are encouraged to present what you have done even if your solution is broken or you weren’t able to finish. It’s okay if you didn’t finish your project, that happens all the time! Completion is only one part of the judging criteria, so you might still do well. Also, demoing is not just about the competition. It’s a chance to share with others what you learned and what you tried to build! In the case that you don’t have anything to demo, you can give a presentation about what you tried and what you learned. Hearing what other people learned is interesting and inspiring for other attendees.</p>

<h3>Judging Criteria</h3>

<p>Teams will be judged on these three criteria. Judges will weigh the criteria equally. During judging, participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their project.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Technology: How technically impressive was the hack? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult? Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components? Did the technology involved make you go “Wow”?</li>
  <li>Idea &amp; Innovation: How good is the idea?, we want to see things that goes beyond a website that already exists, be creative! There are a lot of things that you can do.</li>
  <li>Learning: Did the team stretch themselves? Did they try to learn something new? What kind of projects have they worked on before? If a team which always does virtual reality projects decides to switch up and try doing a mobile app instead, that exploration should be rewarded.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also will be taking in count the design and the usability, so if your application does not look like a 90’s website and it’s intuitive at using it, extra points for you.</p>

<p>These criteria will guide judges but ultimately judges are free to make decisions based on their gut feeling of which projects are the most impressive and most deserving.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that these judging criteria <strong>do not include</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How good your code is. It doesn’t matter if your code is messy, or not well commented, or uses inefficient algorithms. Hacking is about playing around, making mistakes, and learning new things. If your code isn’t production ready, we’re not going to mark you down.</li>
  <li>How well you pitch. Hacking is about building and learning, not about selling.</li>
  <li>How good the idea is. Again, Hackathons aren’t about coming up with innovative ideas. It’s about building and learning.</li>
  <li>How well the project solves a problem. You can build something totally useless and as long as you’re learning and having fun, that’s a good hack! Sometimes a pointless project is one of the best hacks!</li>
</ul>

<p>So don’t worry about coming up with the next big idea or building the next Facebook. You’ll have plenty of time for that outside the hackathon. Just focus on learning, having fun, and making new friends. At the end of the day the skills you learn and the friends you make might lead to the next big thing—but you don’t have to do that to win a hackathon.</p>

<h3>Prizes</h3>
<p>The prizes shall be transferred using one of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li>via wire transfer to a bank account specified by the winner,</li>
  <li>via Amazon or other store voucher purchased in Spain using Euros with a value equivalent to the prize won</li>
  <li>or physically handed to the participant</li>
</ul>

<p>after the announcement of the winners by the Organizer.</p>

<p>The Organizer keeps the right to decide which one of the methods mentioned above is used to give the prizes to each winner, without the need or obligation to make public the followed criteria. The no acceptance of the method chosen by the Organizer will be cause for withdrawal of the prize.</p>

<p>The Organizer shall not take any responsibility for the failure of the participant to avail the prize due to inaccurate information provided by the participant. The Organizer reserves the right to replace any winner if we discover that the winner is or was in breach of these general terms and conditions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prizes are non-exchangeable.</li>
  <li>Quoted prizes might be taxable in your jurisdiction and each winner will be solely responsible for complying with any and all applicable federal, state, provincial, local, or other statutes, regulations, and other laws and for bearing any personal, income, VAT, GST, withholding taxes, customs duties, or other taxes, fees, insurance, surcharges or other costs relating to any reward.</li>
  <li>If the Organizer is obliged to withhold taxes under the applicable laws, the Organizer will do so without any notice.</li>
  <li>The Organizer will cooperate and issue any documents that might be required for tax purposes, but it is the Participant’s obligation to request and collect such documents.</li>
</ul>

<p>All prize winners will be obliged to provide all their tax details to the Organizer, so that the latter can comply with all the formal obligations arising from this promotion. The Organizer will make available to the winners, within the period legally established for this purpose, the certificates of withholdings made.</p>

<p>In order to carry out the delivery of the prize, the winners must provide all information required by the Organizer or third parties on its behalf, such as identity documents, passports, etc.; any delay or failure to provide the required documentation and/or information will be cause for withdrawal of the prize.</p>

<p>Each winner will be responsible for complying with the tax and accounting obligations involved in obtaining the prize for personal taxation purposes..</p>

<p>Accusations of cheating may include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A team using somebody else’s code.</li>
  <li>A team misrepresenting the work they did.</li>
  <li>A team having too many team members.</li>
  <li>A team using code that was written outside the event.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you suspect cheating, please get in touch with the organizers of the event. If you are still at the event, please talk to a Datathon FME organizer. If it is after the event, please email us at the given email address. Don't forget to clearly state the following:

<p>If organizers determine cheating did not occur, they will inform the reporter.</p>

<p>If organizers are unable to determine that cheating did not occur based on publicly available resources, organizers will then communicate with the alleged cheater. Informing them of what has been reported about them and allowing the alleged cheater to give their side of the story to the staff. After this point, if the report stands, the alleged cheater will be informed of what actions will be taken against them.</p>

<p>Actions that organizers will consider when dealing with alleged cheating offenders are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Warning the cheater to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in sanctions.</li>
  <li>Not allowing the participants to demo.</li>
  <li>Not allowing the participants to win prizes.</li>
  <li>Revocation of prizes &amp; recognitions.</li>
  <li>Banning the participants from future events (either indefinitely or for a certain time period).</li>
  <li>Publishing an account of the cheating.</li>
</ul>
